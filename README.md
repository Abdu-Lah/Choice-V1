# Choice Coin
The Choice Coin asset architecture aggregates three keystone characteristics. First, Choice Coin harnesses Algogeneous Smart Contracts on the Algorand Blockchain. Second, Choice Coin utilizes artificial intelligence for optimizing user demand. Third, Choice Coin codifies compliance within its software structure.

# Algogeneous Smart Contracts

Algogeneous Smart Contracts represent a technical convergence of stateless and stateful smart contracts and include an innovative integration with artificial intelligence. Indeed, the confluence of smart contracts and artificial intelligence technologies are driving the edge in decentralized transactions. Stateful and Stateless functionalities are still helpful to the extent they help to explain ASC functionality and to provide subsidiary purposes within the Algogeneous architecture. Utilizing Algogeneous Smart Contracts, Quantum Query can legally and logically validate votes on a global scale for decentralized polling purposes.
